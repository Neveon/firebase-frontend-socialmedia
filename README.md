## What I Learned

1. Learned about React Router `match` prop to access params that are sent down to route component
1. Learned `@material-ui/core` and `@material-ui/styles`. I enjoyed customizing themes with this framework, very easy to use.
1. Learned `Array.from()` to create a new (shallow-copy) Array to iterate

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
